# MAT290 Textbook Notes
In this repository, I will be uploading my textbook and readings notes for [MAT290: Advanced Engineering Mathematics](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mat290h1) by lecture. The notes are organized by week; use the table below to see what topics were covered in each week. To find my notes for other courses I've taken at the University of Toronto, visit [my website](https://arnav-patil-12.github.io/notes/)!
